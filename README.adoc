== Usage

=== Regular usage
Add this module to your microservice's infrastructure like this:

[source, hcl]
----
module "cognito" {
  source = "github.com/nsbno/terraform-aws-central-cognito?ref=x.y.z"

  name_prefix = "infrademo"
  application_name = "demo"

  environment = "dev"

  resource_server_base_url = "infrademo.vydev.io"
  resource_server_scopes   = {
    read = {
      name = "read"
      description = "Allow clients to read data"
    }
  }

  user_pool_client_scopes = [
    "https://rollingstock.vydev.io/traingps/read"
  ]
}
----

=== Client side

For client-side only authentication (authorization_code flow), i.e. Vy SSO in SPAs, you can create a client like this:

[source, hcl]
----
module "cognito" {
  source = "github.com/nsbno/terraform-aws-central-cognito?ref=x.y.z"

  name_prefix = "infrademo"
  application_name = "demo"

  environment = "dev"

  allowed_oauth_flows          = ["code", "implicit"]
  supported_identity_providers = ["vygruppen"]
  # Setting this to false will not generate a secret, thus the client_secret output will be null.
  generate_secret              = false
  callback_urls                = [
    "http://localhost:3000/login",
    "https://${local.site_url}/login"
  ]
  logout_urls                  = [
    "http://localhost:3000/logout",
    "https://${local.site_url}/logout"
  ]

  user_pool_client_scopes = [
    "openid",
    "email",
    "phone",
    "https://rollingstock.vydev.io/traingps/read"
  ]
}
